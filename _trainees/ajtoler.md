### Biography and Interests
 
I am a third year graduate student currently progressing towards a PhD at the UMass Amherst on the ATLAS Experiment. 

### Project 
I am contributing to the Level 0 Monitored Drift Tube (L0MDT) effort through simulation and performance studies and support the firmware design, focusing on the impact of inefficiencies in the detectors and studying possible updates to improve robustness. Seperately, I am also beginning to contribute to the displaced Heavy Neutral Lepton (right-handed sterile neutrino) analysis.
